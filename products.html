              <h4 class="otherGamesText">Rank is a fast-paced shedding card game, which
              means you try to get rid of all your cards before the other players and
              obtain the highest rank. In Rank, players utilize numbered cards, special
              cards, and strategy to out think their opponents and play all their cards first.<br><br>

              The most important thing to remember is to not get stuck with only low cards towards the
              end, or you are going to lose! The first player to get rid of all their cards becomes the
              King. Each time a player becomes/stays the King, they receive 2 Royal tokens. If you end
              the hand as the Queen, you receive 1 Royal token. Get 5 Royal tokens and you are the winner!</h4>

            <h4 class="otherGamesText">Clash of the Cards is a high-speed, strategic battle
              card game in which you battle your opponents to steal their cards and create armies.
              To win each hand of this rummy-style game, you try collect 2 armies (an army is a set of 4).
              The first player to collect 2 armies wins the hand, and then all players get to count any completed army points.
              Keep playing hands until someone reaches 1,000 points.<br><br>

            To add to the fun, each card in the game can be harnessed in a variety of ways during the game.
            You can use special cards to defend your armies, walk away from a battle, slow down your opponents,
            or join battles you were not invited in order to increase your chance at winning cards which help you build your armies.
            Clash of the Cards allows you to set traps for other players and develop attack and defense strategies from your very first turn.</h4>

              <h4 class="otherGamesText">Bamboozled is a fast-paced bluffing dice/card game.
              In this hilarious new game you try to outwit your friends and family and be the last one standing.  Players
              roll dice in subsequent turns and must get a higher roll than the previous player.  If they don't they
              have to convince the next player that they did.  If a player calls a bluff the bluffing player gets a strike.  3 strikes and you're out!
              <br><br>
              BUT! Each player starts with an action card that will help
              you bluff or force someone else to make the call.  Even if you have to bluff you may
              be able to use an action card to make it true and give the other player a strike, so play
              your cards carefully.
              <br><br>
              Players can also get more cards by BAMBOOZLING other players, meaning, if you bluff and no one calls you on it, you get another card.
